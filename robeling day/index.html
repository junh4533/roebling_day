    <h2>John Augustus Roebling</h2>
    <h5>Architect and visionary</h5>
    <br>
    <p>In 1867, John Augustus Roebling introduced his his pioneering concept of the Brooklyn Bridge, which involves a steel wire suspension bridge spanning nearly 1600 feet. Despite his death prior to the construction completion of the bridge on May 24,
      1883, his legacy is still highly regarded a century after its completion. The purpose of this event is to show appreciation for Roebling's achievements. His design of the Brooklyn Bridge has enabled cultural, technological, and infrastructural growth
      throughout the city.

    <div class="container" style="text-align:center">
      <p>The New-York Historical Society was established in 1804 as New York’s first museum. Its eleven founders all lived through the turbulent years of the American Revolution and the British occupation of New York. These men believed that New York’s citizens
        needed to take decisive action to preserve eyewitness evidence of their own historical moment, which they recognized as important, fearing “dust and obscurity” would be the inevitable fate of accounts and artifacts if left in the hands of private
        individuals. “Without the aid of original records and authentic documents,” they declared, “history will be nothing more than a well-combined series of ingenious conjectures and amusing fables.”</p>
